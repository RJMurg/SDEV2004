"The wild Atlantic with its unrestrained and untameable tides and storms, "
"has continuously been moulding the west coast of Ireland. With a constant"
" meeting of water and land, a deeply indented and wild terrain has "
"emerged with towering cliffs, spellbinding bays and beaches, mystical "
"islands, always changing and never reaching the end. In the isolation or "
"perhaps expressed in a different way, living near and with the Atlantic "
"at your doorstep has ensured that old traditions and the Irish language "
"have been preserved. A trip along the Wild Atlantic Way is also an "
"encounter with the past."
